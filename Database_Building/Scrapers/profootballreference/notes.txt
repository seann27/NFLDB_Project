Problems:
- Fix bugs for seasons 2012-2018
- 2011 web pages are broken/are missing most of the tables
    - can't scrape player info from snapcounts OR any other tables
        - need to find a way to generate player teams on the fly using play-by-play and drives
        - scrape drives tables into 2 different lists
        - for every play, turn a switch to the team on offense based on if the time is in their drive table
        - update the teams the players are on for their metrics
            - will need to figure out how to indicate fumble recoveries
                - possibly pass in drive lists and times to indicate change of possession?
    - missing kick/punt return tds
        - will need to grab these stats on the fly as well from play-by-play
    - missing defensive stats
        - can grab these stats from existing player_dict for all offense
- Move defensive stats scraping to analyze play?
- set up architecture so that everything is scraped only from pbp if one of the tables is missing
