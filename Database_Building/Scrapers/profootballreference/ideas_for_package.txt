Ideas to put all relevant scrapers into package:
1) create parent class that initializes url and converts to web page
2) have a profootball reference scraper class that inherits class from step 1
   - have generic methods, use this as parents class
   - create classes for each type of web page (game, week, team, player)
   - return dataframes
3) have a fantasypros scraper
  - create classes to download rankings, projections
