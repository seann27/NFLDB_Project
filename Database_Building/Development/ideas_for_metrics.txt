Calculate performance metrics:

term1 - average skillpoints per game
term2 - average skillpoints allowed by opponent per game
term3 - actual skillpoints in the game

offensive performance = (term1 * term3) / (term2 * term3)
defensive performance = 1/offensive performance
 
term5 - avg def performance
term6 - avg ranking of offense the opp has faced
term7 - avg off ranking
term8 - avg opp def ranking

experimental_term8 - projected offensive performance using terms 1,2,5,6,7

apply these terms to each category (run, short pass, deep pass) 

feature set includes these terms for favorite, underdog, spread, over/under

skillpoints table per team by week would be helpful
  -> for recieving metrics, separate skillpoints out by rb,te,wr
  -> for rushing, split by qb/rb
  
skillpoints table:

once player info is in database:
team, opponent, qb_rush_sp, rb_rush_sp, rb_srec_sp, te_srec_sp, wr_srec_sp, rb_drec_sp, te_drec_sp, wr_drec_sp

but for now focus on team stats:
team, team_rank, opponent, opp_def_rank, rush_sp, short_pass_sp, deep_pass_sp,

will build metrics table to store terms 1-7
  -> start with overall metrics
  -> can add positional metrics, home vs away metrics
