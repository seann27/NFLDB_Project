Need to add season/week/defteam data back into dataframe
Types of metadata to possibly include in regression analysis?
    - player points per game
    - player yards per rush (each direction)
    - player yards per catch (each direction)
    - player yards per pass (each direction)
    * last 3 games *
    - team rushing percentage
    - team passing percentage
    - team yards per rush allowed (each direction)
    - team yards per pass/catch allowed (each direction)
    - history of RB/WR/QB performance scores
        - take average points per game, compare %+/- performance against specific team
        - to get metrics such as:
            - running backs tend to do better/worse than they normally do against other opponents
    - projected scores (take over/under, spread to calculate)
What are the labels supposed to be?
    - fantasy points?
    - flex yards per player?
        - total?
        - per direction?
    - team flex yards?
        - per direction?
