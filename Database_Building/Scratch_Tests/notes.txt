Need to add season/week/defteam data back into dataframe
Types of metadata to possibly include in regression analysis?
    - player points per game
    - player yards per rush (each direction)
    - player yards per catch (each direction)
    - player yards per pass (each direction)
    * last 3 games *
    - team rushing percentage
    - team passing percentage
    - team yards per rush allowed (each direction)
    - team yards per pass/catch allowed (each direction)
    - history of RB/WR/QB performance scores
        - take average points per game, compare %+/- performance against specific team
        - to get metrics such as:
            - running backs tend to do better/worse than they normally do against other opponents
    - projected scores (take over/under, spread to calculate)
What are the labels supposed to be?
    - fantasy points?
    - flex yards per player?
        - total?
        - per direction?
    - team flex yards?
        - per direction?

select distinct gameid and rusher player ids to get all players who had rushing attempts
iterate over list, getting summary stats for each iteration
    possibly have generic sql statement which can be fed parameters?
repeat for passing play types for QBS and receivers

PSEUDOCODE FOR POPULATING FLEX SUMMARY TABLES:
    dataframe df = select distinct gameid,player id where play type = rush
    df["key"] = df["gameid"].map(str) + df["rusher_player_id"]
    df.set_index("key")
    function(location params):
        dataframe rushdf = rush_sql(location params)
        rushdf["key"] = rushdf["gameid"].map(str) + rushdf["rusher_player_id"]
        rushdf.set_index("key")
        return rushdf
    for param in location params:
        dflocationparam = function(location params)
        df.join(dflocationparam,how="outer")
