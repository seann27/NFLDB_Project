Populate all actual player stats
Populate all player projections

Make sure all team, season, and week fields are filled in appropriately in all tables for players

Create module to normalize data (team names from different websites)

create module to calculate espn fantasy points based on stats and dk points based on stats

clean up scripts to utilize modules and to automatically add season/week to appropriate tables

use fantasy point projections as dataframe for dk for next week

calculate "corrected" projections based on trends, graphs, stats
linear regression model?

create_table optimal_lineups (id int primary key auto_increment,season int,week int,
QB1 varchar(100),
RB1 varchar(100), RB2 varchar(100),
WR1 varchar(100), WR2 varchar(100), WR3 varchar(100)

select p.*,e.proj_points from player_model p, espn_player_projections e where p.id=e.id and p.week=14 and p.dk_salary <= 3800 and p.position='WR' order by p.fp_rank asc;
