Concepts of an ML project:
There are 8 main steps:
1) Frame the problem
2) Get the data
3) Explore the data to gain insights (patterns)
4) Prepare the data
    a) clean it up to expose it to ML patterns
5) Explore many different models and pick the best ones
6) Fine-tune the models and combine them into a solution
7) Present the solution
8) launch with a test set

Chapter 2 Review:
- get the data
- frame the label you are trying to get from the data
- create training/test sets
    - requires some preprocessing to filter out bias
- look for correlations of the label attribute
    - can run data.corr() or plot scatter matrix of attributes
    - scatter matrix graphs a list of attributes against each other
- add custom attributes by combining existing ones
PIPELINE:
- clean up data by handling N/A values in dataset
- handle categorical or text data with encoders
- need to create custom transformer classes
    - need to have fit(), transform(), and fit_transform() methods
    - fit_transform() can be imported with TransformerMixin
    - this is where you add combined attributes
- scale the data so it is distributed evenly
RESULT: Imputer (cleaner) -> transformer (adds attributes) -> scaler
- write a DataFrameAcceptor class to process Pandas Dataframes
- Join two piplines (numerical and categorical) with FeatureUnion
- Result is a prepared dataset
MODEL SELECTION:
- test out different models
- pick a model
- perform cross-validation on it
